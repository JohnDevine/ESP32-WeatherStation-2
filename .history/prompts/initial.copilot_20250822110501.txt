create an application uses a bme680 connected to an ESP32. Use the documentation on the BME689 in /Volumes/Work01/Developer/ESP32Projects/Learn-Unity/Hardware to create a suitable device driver. Do not use a library.  It connects to a local network. It takes the temperature from the sensor and sends it to an MQTT server. It does this every 5 seconds. The development environment is a Mac 16 Gb running vsc with platformio and uses the espressif if framework. It does NOT use the arduino framework. Use the unity framework from espressif . Create separate files for each component such as temperature.c and temperature.h for temperature related functions. Add documentation suitable for doxygen documentation generation. Generate all the necessary files for a unity test environment. NOTE: USE THE main.cpp IN SRC FOR THE ENTRY POINT, NOT CREATE A NEW main.c

# Version Manager Script
# This is a placeholder for the version management script
# When implemented, this script will:
# 1. Generate version.h with project version information
# 2. Track file-level versions
#
# For C/C++ only implementation, this script is optional
# as the core functionality is implemented in version.h and version.c

Import("env")

# Get the project name (directory name by default)
project_name = env.get("PROJECT_NAME", env.Dir("#").get_abspath().split("/")[-1])

print("Version Manager: Project Name = " + project_name)
print("Version Manager: Using project version " + env.GetProjectOption("PROJECT_VERSION", "1.0.0"))

# This is a placeholder - no actual modifications needed for C/C++ only approach
